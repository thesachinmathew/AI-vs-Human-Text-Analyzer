🤖 AI Text Detector
AI Text Detector is a desktop application built with Python and Tkinter that analyzes a given text and predicts whether it was written by a human or generated by AI. The system uses a simple rule-based detection algorithm inspired by common linguistic and structural patterns found in AI-generated versus human-written text.

🧠 Key Features
🔍 Text Analysis Engine: Uses rule-based logic to detect AI/human patterns in the text.

🎨 Dark Themed GUI: Sleek, aesthetic interface with background animations and a glowing neural-style design.

📊 Confidence Score: Displays how confident the system is in its prediction.

📈 Live Stats: Shows word count, character count, and sentence count of the input.

⚡ Fast & Lightweight: No external machine learning models required; works offline.

🧪 Ready for Extension: Easily upgradable to include trained ML models like BERT.
